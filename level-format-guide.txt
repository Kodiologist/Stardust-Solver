Hiya.  This resource is for you, the person looking into the resource fork, and not for the game itself.If you haven't worked it out already these 'TEXT' resources house the information for the levels in the game.  That meansit is VERY easy for you to alter the levels if you want to.I only ask that you keep a copy of the original levels, so thatif you want to distribute the program over a BBS or give acopy to a friend, they can play the original game.Also, if any programmer has the spare time to write a leveleditor for this game, please send me a copy.  I'll distributeit, with credits, along with every copy of Stardust.
